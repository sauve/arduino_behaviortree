# arduino_behaviortree
behavior tree simple example

Simple project implementing a behavior tree with the arduino ATMEGA and SAMD architecture.

# Code

## Project structure

- behaviortree_test : Arduino project
- python : Python utilty code
- doc : autogenerated documentation

## Compilation

Tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.5

## Main classes

* BehaviorTreeNode
* BehaviorTreeVisitor
* BehaviorTree
* BlackBoard
* BehaviorHandler

### BehaviorTreeNode

Encapsulate the basic element of a node. Methodes for initialization, debug and memory management.

### BehaviorTreeVisitor

Use to navigate through the node hierarchically. Use an list to maintain the traversal memory wihout allocating memory dynamically.

### BehaviorTree

Contains a pool of a finite amount of BehaviorNode and methodes to add an remove them.  

### BlackBoard

Contains and managed a finite amount of data slots accessible via a key in a form of a number between 0 and 254.

### BehaviorHandler

Implement node  processing based on the type and data properties.

# Behavior nodes 

* Composite
	* Sequence
	* Loop
	* Parallel
	* Selector
* Decorator
	* Inverter
	* Success
	* Failure
* Specialized
	* Proxy
